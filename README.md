# Analysis

Repository designed to track the progress and issues of my analysis.

## Goals

#### Spring 2026

- [ ] Merge R-hadron decays into CMSSW
- [ ] Produce private MC samples w/ 1800GeV gluino decaying to heavy quarks and 1300GeV neutralino with ctau=1000mm
- [ ] Create cutflow in new framework
- [ ] Obtain background samples from DAS
- [ ] Produce more private MC samples with lifetimes ctau={0.1-10,000}mm
- [ ] Request centrally produced MC samples

#### Fall 2026

- [ ] Change and improve cuts, create signal region with ABCD background prediction
- [ ] Begin writing CMS paper while we wait on centrally produced MC samples
- [ ] Unblind signal region with data

#### Spring 2027

- [ ] Finish writing the CMS paper
- [ ] Begin finishing thesis
- [ ] Complete CMS group pre-approval

#### Fall 2027

- [ ] Complete CMS collaboration-wide review
- [ ] Submit analysis paper to journal
- [ ] Complete dissertation and thesis defense
